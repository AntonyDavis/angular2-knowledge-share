# Angular 2 Knowledge Share

version: 0.1.0

This project contains two things:
- a powerpoint presentation that discusses Angular 1.x's problems, the motivation behind Angular 2.0 and how to transform and Angular 1.x Directive/Controller into an Angular 2.0 Web Component
- a working application [originally found here](https://github.com/thelgevold/angular-2-samples.git) to which I have added a concrete example of the transformation mentioned in point 1.


## Setup

After cloning the project repository, you can view the presentation in powerpoint.

To setup the application, you will need:
- npm
- vscode
- http-server

VSCode is Microsoft's new IDE and cross-platform. You can get it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

Once you have installed npm, you can get hold of http-server by typing:

`npm install -g http-server`

##Usage

To run the application:

- open *\angular2-knowledge-share\typescript-angular2* folder in *VSCode*
- right-click on *index.html*
- select *Open in Command Prompt*
- once the command prompt has opened, type http-server

- **NOTE**: it is very important the http-server is run in the same directory as *index.html* otherwise it will not work
